**Project description:** 
Transit Oriented Development has been a trend that promotes more housing and mixed-use amenities near public transportation. While such development can potentially increase efficiency of transit system operation, it can also be beneficial for land value capitalization which would generate more property tax revenue for the city. To examine whether TOD development would be suitable for our city, we studied TOD in Chicago by comparing socio-demographic information, rent, and crime data between TOD and non-TOD areas across 2009 and 2017. We also examined the relationship between distance to transit stations and rent.
